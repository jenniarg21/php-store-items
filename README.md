# php-store-items
A PHP page which uses MySQL to display grocery store items.

This was a short assignment in which we were to:
  - Create a database and populate it
  - Pull data from the database and display it on the page
  - Use pagination to limit the amount of pulled data to be displayed
  - Additionally, there's a simple filtering option
